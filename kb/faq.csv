Grades of P do not satisfy prerequisite requirements when a minimum letter grade (for example C- or higher) is required to advance to the next course. Some exceptions may apply from the spring 2020 semester, due to the policy modified during the COVID-19 health emergency.

**Grading:** Students will receive either a grade of “P” (pass) or “F” (fail) for coursework completed under the option. A grade of “P” has no impact on the student’s overall grade point average. A grade of “F” will have the same effect on the grade point average as a traditional failure. Please note that a “P” grade may not be accepted for transfer at other institutions, or may impact the success of graduate school or professional school applications in the future.
