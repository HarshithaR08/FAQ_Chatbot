Grades of P do not satisfy prerequisite requirements when a minimum letter grade (for example C- or higher) is required to advance to the next course. Some exceptions may apply from the spring 2020 semester, due to the policy modified during the COVID-19 health emergency.\n\n**Grading:** Students will receive either a grade of “P” (pass) or “F” (fail) for coursework completed under the option.

Please note that a “P” grade may not be accepted for transfer at other institutions, or may impact the success of graduate school or professional school applications in the future.\n\n**Credit and Term Limits:** Students may take up to 12 semester hours total as pass/fail.", "source_url": "https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/pass-fail-grading/", "bucket": "policies", "headings": ["H1: Pass/Fail Grading – Undergraduate Students", "H2: About This Policy"], "chunk_id": "sha1:b4edab6e6a7bb20950d3e28abcf7e51124264359"}
